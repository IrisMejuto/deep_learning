# ðŸªŸ Project Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced deep learning model to predict the engagement level generated by tourist points of interest (POIs). The model adopts a multimodal approach: it integrates both visual features extracted from images (using CNNs) and structured metadata such as category, location, and popularity. All data is sourced from the Artgonuts platform and public open datasets, focusing mainly on Spanish tourist attractions.

# ðŸŽ¯ Main goal:
To classify each POI as likely to generate high or low user engagement, combining both aesthetic/visual signals and contextual information.

# ðŸ“ŽDataset
- Total samples: 1,569 POIs

## Features:

- Images: One representative image per POI (preprocessed for modeling).

## Metadata:

- ID, name, short description

- Location (latitude, longitude, district, neighborhood)

- Categories (multi-label, up to 224 unique types)

- Tier (relevance/popularity level)

- Gamification points (xps)

- Tags

- Engagement metrics: visits, likes, dislikes, bookmarks

- Format: CSV for tabular data, directory-structured images.

# Methodology
## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
No missing values in the data.

- Numerical features: Likes, dislikes, bookmarks show high skew (few POIs get most interactions). Visits are very homogeneous, so they are excluded from engagement.

- Categories: 224 unique, mostly related to heritage and culture.

- Geolocation: Majority of POIs in Spain (Madrid, Balearic Islands).

- Text features: Descriptions have consistent length.

## 2. Target Variable: Engagement Metric

- Formula: 
  Engagement = 0.4*Likes + 0.4*Bookmarks - 0.2*Dislikes

- Normalization: MinMaxScaler to [0, 1].

- Rationale: Balances positive and negative interactions. Excludes visits to avoid data leakage.

## 3. Preprocessing
- Categories: MultiLabelBinarizer for multi-category columns.

- Numerical: MinMaxScaler for tier and xps.

- Images: Resize, normalization, and conversion to PyTorch tensors.

- Dataset split: Stratified into train (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets based on engagement.

## 4. Model Architecture

- Multimodal design:

  - Image branch: Pretrained ResNet50 for visual feature extraction.
  
  - Tabular branch: Fully connected layers for categorical/numerical features.
  
  - Fusion: Concatenation and final dense layers.
  
  - Loss function: MSELoss (regression to engagement score).

## 5. Training & Validation
- Optimizer: Adam

- Learning rate: 0.001 (with scheduler)

- Evaluation: Loss curves indicate no overfitting; validation loss plateaus after ~10 epochs.
